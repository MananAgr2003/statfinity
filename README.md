## Cool Features & Technologies

- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Leveraging Next.js' powerful server-side rendering, our project fetches real-time Pokémon data from [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) to ensure up-to-date information.
- **Interactive Card Flips:** With [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), the Pokémon cards feature smooth 3D flip animations on hover, offering an engaging visual experience.
- **Responsive and Adaptive Design:** Utilizing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), the interface is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- **Intuitive Search & Toggle Views:** Easily explore over 151 Pokémon via dynamic search capabilities and switch between grid and list views to view your preferred layout.
- **Custom Typography & Styling:** Incorporates unique fonts like 'Press Start 2P' along with a fresh design aesthetic, adding a fun and nostalgic vibe to the browsing experience.

### Why Our Project Stands Out

Our Pokémon Explorer isn't just another Pokédex clone – it's designed with both performance and user experience in mind. Here’s what makes it special:

- **Enhanced Interactivity:** The smooth GSAP animations and dynamic layouts create an immersive and fun experience not seen in typical implementations.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with the latest in Next.js and Tailwind CSS, our project is optimized for performance and scalability.
- **User-Centric Design:** With features like real-time data fetching and intuitive UI controls, Pokémon enthusiasts and casual users alike will appreciate the seamless navigation and engaging visuals.
- **Clean and Scalable Code:** We prioritize maintainability and clarity in our code, making it easier to extend and customize for future enhancements.

Happy exploring!

## Getting Started

cd pokemon-explorer

npm install

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
